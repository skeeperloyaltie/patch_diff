### diff and patch Programs
- This repository contains two programs, diff.py and patch.py, that implement the functionality of the Unix tools diff and patch. The programs allow one to compare two files and use the output and one of the files to produce the other file.

```diff.py```
- ```diff.py``` takes in two files as command line arguments and outputs the differences between them in the format of a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an operation ('+' for added lines, '-' for removed lines) and the line of text.

### Usage
- To run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then run the command:

    ```python diff.py file1 file2```

Replace ```"file1"``` and ```"file2"``` with the actual names of the files you want to compare.

```patch.py```
- ```patch.py``` takes in a file name and the output of the diff.py program as command line arguments and modifies the file to match the other file.

### Usage
- To run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then run the command:

    ```python patch.py file diff```
- Replace ```"file"``` with the name of the file you want to modify and "diff" with the name of the file containing the output of the diff.py script.

### Note
- Please note that these programs are just an example, you can add more functionality and change it according to your needs.

- The diff.py and patch.py programs provide a basic implementation of the functionality of the Unix tools diff and patch. They can be used as a starting point for more advanced file comparison and patching functionality. Feel free to modify and use the code in your own projects.
